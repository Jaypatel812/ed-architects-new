            <div className="text-justify">
              ED architects was established in 2008 by Ar. Dhaval Dobariya, Ar.
              Mehul Gajjar and Ar. Vishal Harsora. The trio who pursued their
              architecture degree from MS University, met as fellow students
              back in 2004. Their expertise on the subject and a passion to do
              something of their own brought them together. Soon the trio shared
              a room together and started taking up small-scale projects. Later,
              they bagged a project of their own – an army training campus.
              After successfully completing their degrees, all three began their
              professional careers. Mehul worked in HCP and CEPT University,
              Dhaval under Ar. Kiran Kapadia, Mumbai and Vishal worked for Ar.
              Bhaskar Narula, Ahmedabad. From their humble beginning in 2008 to
              today, Ahmedabad’s vibrancy is a constant source of inspiration
              for them. Their detail in crafting and their willingness to
              constantly churn out fresh and contemporary designs, kept them
              going. Working with your ideas, they can nurture your project from
              conception to completion. Their innovative and inter-disciplinary
              skill-set, and extensive network of suppliers, means they can take
              a project from the first sketch right through to construction and
              completion.

              ED architects believe in building landmarks. We make sure that
              every structure we build is etched in everyone’s minds. We want
              the owners of the building to be proud of the structure. To make
              that happen, we combine your ideas with ours to inspire the design
              and blend this with our technical expertise. This helps us in
              preparing detailed drawings and specifications for the delivery of
              your project. We put in place the right teams, systems and
              methodologies to deliver tailored solutions. Our team can help you

            <div className="font-bold mb-3">How We Design</div>
            <div className="text-justify">
              The architectural practice of ED architects has evolved
              exponentially since establishment. We endeavour to make a
              difference in our clients’ lives and business practice by building
              a structure which can be recognized as a landmark. The firm brings
              out the individual characteristics of the site and the client’s
              personalized requirements. Whether it’s a backyard extension or a
              city skyline, the fundamental concerns of natural light, passive
              ventilation, social interaction and sensitive material selection
              are vital to every project taken up by ED Architects. Our design
              philosophy is deeply rooted in the historic traditions of
              architecture: classical proportion and scale, the balance of
              shadow and light, and the importance of the sustainable
              relationship between materials. We strive to integrate the most
              innovative design strategies into every project which result in a
              one-of-a-kind, unique, and customized space. Many of the
              facilities that we have worked on include several buildings on
              large sites, and they are quite impressive at master planning for
              multiple uses.

            <div className="text-justify">
              Whether we design a factory building, a residence, a commercial
              space or an interior facility, we follow similar guidelines
              towards completing each project. We understand that each project
              and each individual is different and our team works towards
              combining all of their needs into our design philosophy. Before we
              begin each project, our team conducts intensive research combined
              with the process of drawing and modelling the project. This gives
              us a better insight into creating the best space for our clients.
              We understand that delivering the project on budget is of prime
              importance. We pride ourselves on listening and maintaining a
              meaningful dialogue through the design, construction and handover
              stages. As the size of the project grows, the number of
              consultants, authorities, contractors also grow. We always make
              sure that we guide and co-ordinate with the group from start to
              finish. During both the design and construction phases, we work
              closely with our client and all connected faculties and make sure
              that the project is on course.
